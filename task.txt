observations like wind speed in knots, temperature in degrees celsius, etc.)
in parquet or avro format aggregated hourly and in a batch of at least X
items. Respond with error details for items failed validation. Ensure strong
separation between core and infrastructure code. Do you best to provide best
possible code maintainability and testability within reasonable period of
1-3 days.
